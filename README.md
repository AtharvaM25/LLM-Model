# A domain specific (Harry-Potter series) chatbot
This project works like a chatbot that gives vague or generic replies based on the data it was trained on.

# Overview
This project is based on the training of LLM on a domain specific dataset like Harry Potter series. The LLM receives prompts from the user, it then tries to understand the key words and generates an answer.
